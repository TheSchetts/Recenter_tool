# Recenter_tool
Its a tool for Autodesk Maya to recenter your models directly on the world origin even after you have froze transformations.
Py-mel code. 
It was a final project for my maya scripting class at VCAD. It opens up a ui window that allows you to recenter the last selected object on the world center. You can freeze transforms and delete history move the pivot point in any direction by one point and export the selection.
